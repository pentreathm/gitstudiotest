###Paging
  
Though Blaze does not currently implement OData, this paging borrows syntax from the [OData protocol](http://www.odata.org/documentation/).

When fetching from Blaze, use the following query parameters:
* **$skip** - the number of rows to skip; e.g. if you have a page size of 10 and are on page 3: *$skip=20*
* **$top** - the size of the result set (page size)
* **$orderby** - the sort order; e.g. to order by client code and descending date created: *$orderby=clientCode,dateCreated desc*. Note, the default sort order (when unspecified) is asc.

Example: __GET__ ```{server}/api/1.0/potentials/invoices?$skip=20&$top=10&$orderby=clientCode,dateCreated desc```
