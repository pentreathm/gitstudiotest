      Returns a list of conversion rates where each rate is the price of the _toCurrencyCode_ in terms of 1 _fromCurrencyCode_. In other words the rate at which the _fromCurrencyCode_ will be exchanged for the _toCurrencyCode_.
    
      ###Example:
      
      _toCurrencyCode_ = USD
      
      _fromCurrencyCode_ = ZAR
      
      rate returned = 11.0929926 
      
      The quotation USD/ZAR 11.0929926 means that 1 US dollar is able to buy 11.0929926 South African Rand.
