        All potential invoices that are considered by blaze to be fully resolved (good to use when pulling invoices into external systems). The following criteria are evaluated:
        
        * Must have an Amount
        * Must have a valid Country Code
        * Must have a valid Currency Code
        * Must have a valid Date
        * Must have a valid Expense Type
        * Must have no outstanding calculations
        * Must either not have an image attachment, or have fully resolved its image attachment

        Do you want to force calculations to be run straight after invoice post? 
        
        * **sync**: This will run the calculations immediately, and calculation results will be in the response. Any failure will manifest in an error response.  
        * **async**: Will run calculations asynchronously, but return immediately (i.e. before the calcs finish). Any errors must be picked up from the administrator logs. No calculation results will be returned.
        * **none**: Do not run calculations immediately, wait for the Blaze synchronization process.
        
        **Note:** Any calculation failure will be picked up, and re-run at normal Blaze synchronization intervals. Failure to run calculations does not necessarily denote failure to insert items. If you want definitive results for the insertion, prefer **async** or **none** calcs.
